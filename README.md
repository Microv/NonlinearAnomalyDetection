# NonlinearAnomalyDetection

Tester program to explore *Nonlinear Analysis* in a Network Anomaly detector.

The tester is meant to work mainly with [ISCX-UNB IDS](http://www.unb.ca/research/iscx/dataset/iscx-IDS-dataset.html) dataset, but it can be adapted to work with other datasets, like [DARPA 1999](https://www.ll.mit.edu/ideval/data/1999data.html), [DARPA 2000](https://www.ll.mit.edu/ideval/data/2000data.html), [CTU-13](http://mcfp.weebly.com/the-ctu-13-dataset-a-labeled-dataset-with-botnet-normal-and-background-traffic.html) or with a custom dataset. 

The output of the tester is an ARFF file to be used with Weka.
